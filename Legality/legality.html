                  <p>Reach Higher is a subcontracted project under the Institute of International Education’s Platform for Education in Emergencies Response (IIE PEER) database.  IIE PEER has a lean team who is building out a scholarship database, starting primarily with Syrian refugee populations but expanding globally over the remainder of the calendar year to in-need countries, including a second round roll-out to ten countries and then a third roll-out that will include the Reach Higher project, which focuses on Rwandan in-country scholarship.  Several databases – including but not limited to Kepler University’s internal scholarship database, the UNHCR listings, Gajang, and Scholars4Dev – have comprehensive information but have little actionable support to accompany the applicant through the process.  Through this merged partnership with IIE PEER, Reach Higher will remove a focus on the human aspect of the application process by building out the advising elements of the application process.  
                    Reach Higher will do this through two means – first, through an effective digitized resource platform that guides a student through the application process step-by-step.  Students will benefit through open-ended questions that allow them to productively work on their own through the application process.  We will model this approach off the techniques established through Harvard University Graduate School of Education’s Career Services Office, which recently pioneered a platform of guidance for pre-arrival on career advising.   </p>
                </div>
                <div class="col-sm">
                  <p> The value of a platform like this is that is can be done offline with pre-loaded videos and worksheets, so students in low-connectivity areas will still benefit from this guidance.  It will allow for scalability of support as students will not need a live-advisor in order to get to the point of an application.  
                    The complexities of the application process for refugees is great, so we are also working with IIE to train their advisors as the second aspect of our Reach Higher program.  This training will be done online with the possibility of an in-person training at the IIE PEER headquarters in New York if the funding allows.  We will work with IIE PEER to build out sustainable advising trainer toolkits, assessment mechanism, and data tracking of applicants who receive this advising support.  In the second round of advising, we will look toward alumni of the program to also get involved through chat forums to share knowledge and create a sense of community and support in the application process.  Our team has on-the-ground connections in Rwanda where we will capitalize on local partnerships, pre-existing programming and community centers, and support in the academic sphere to allow for successful lift-off of the advising platform and outreach to refugee applicants in both urban centers in Rwanda and the refugee camps, with an initial focus on Mahama and Kiziba refugee camps.

                <div class="col-sm">
                  <p> Finally, we have confirmed partnership from the National Association of Fellowships Advisors and an informal partnership with the International ACAC to source advisors with pre-existing expertise in the field of college counselling to serve as our initial cohort of trained advisors through the Reach Higher train-the-trainer program.  
                    youth unemployment, and primary education are much higher demand issues.  However, there is notable movement with NARIC and the European Qualifications Passport for Refugees (EQPR) at the moment allowing for better assessment of needs for college ready students, which shows that at the EU level there is energy and momentum towards allowing for more displaced individuals to continue their study.  Governments have begun to interface less with day-to-day crises and the emergency response in an EU context and have begun to look more long-term.  With that shift, there is a realization that a trained cohort of local community members with degrees in an area of study that will not allow them to work in just any job after graduation, but in a profession where they have passion and qualifications, will allow for rebuilding.  Reach Higher is capitalizing on this wave of momentum by providing IIE PEER with the right cohort of advisors and the right training materials to allow for the best outcome of matched scholars with prior allocated funding.
